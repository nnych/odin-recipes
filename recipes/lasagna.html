  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>"The sweet Italian sausage and ground beef combo along with the sauce were very flavorful," says one Allrecipes community member. "Yeah it may take a while but it is so worth it. Team it with garlic bread and a salad and you'll be very satisfied."</p>

  <ul>
    <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
    <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>

    <li>½ cup water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
