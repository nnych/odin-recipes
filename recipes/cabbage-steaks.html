    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Cabbage steaks are one of my favorite side dishes, and they are very easy to make! I personally love garlic so I go crazy with it, but put as much as is good for you. This is a very simple recipe and you can put as much or as little of the seasonings you want.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
